# Hey! I’m Chris Pennington 👋
I’m a relatively new self-taught front-end developer who loves to learn through teaching.

---
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 I’m a husband and father (of three kids).
- 📹 I started posting videos to YouTube quietly in 2021 as a way to track my own learning and force myself to explain the code I was writing. It was never supposed to be “a thing.”
- 🎒 I’m currently learning NodeJS and React.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love all things outdoors (hiking, climbing, skiing, etc.), soccer, coffee, arts and crafts, and playing piano.
